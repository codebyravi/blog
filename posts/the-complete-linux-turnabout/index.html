<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ever since I found some good stuff at Linux, I wiped out my
hard drive completely, exclusively install a Linux-based
machine, and left Microsoft Windows behind.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s some details and experiences about my complete turnaround
for my computer workflow:</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_my_new_os">My new OS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I used to dual-boot my machine with Windows and whatever Linux-based
distro I was comfortable to use at the time. For the last 8 months or so,
I&#8217;ve been using <a href="https://manjaro.org/">Manjaro</a> only because of the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository">Arch User Repository</a>
which has a large selection of software while not fully tipping my toe into
using Arch Linux and the effort of maintaining it is minimal because it
abstracts it away from you. Not to mention the
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/">official package list of Arch Linux</a> is also
a beast. It was the best of both worlds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end, it didn&#8217;t work out since I found out 8 months later that Manjaro
withholds the recently released/upgraded software from Arch Linux before updating
their own for security reasons. That didn&#8217;t go well for me since I thought it&#8217;s
doesn&#8217;t really hold the point of using Arch-based distros anymore so I thought to
dive into the OG of Arch-based distros: <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my first few days, installing Arch Linux is a difficult task especially I have
no idea how Linux works in the grand picture. I was looking up to the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">Arch Wiki</a> in my phone all day at the time double-checking
every time I step up one more step in the instructions. I took me about 5 installations
before I got it correctly and cruise through without much worrying.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Booting up a functional Arch Linux that I tried and installed is a challenge well
done and satisfied with.
It seriously feels good when I got it working.
Not to mention that I gain some nuts and bolts knowledge on Linux as well.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_my_newfound_workflow">My newfound workflow</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since a fresh installation of Arch Linux is very minimal, I took it as an
opportunity to have a completely new set of programs to fiddle with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing in consideration is a desktop environment but I saw
an alternative way of using a "desktop" with
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/window_manager">window managers</a>.
Since my workflow is simple and I don&#8217;t need more fancy getup that one usually gets
from DEs, I decided to try it out for some change.
And it was cool.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_first_window_manager">First window manager</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I decided to use <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> for my first window manager.
The first time I use it doesn&#8217;t bring up a bad experience.
It was easy to adapt to it since I&#8217;m completely used to using programs
that live in a command line interface like <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/the-complete-linux-turnabout/i3-setup.webp" alt="My i3 setup">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. My i3 setup</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>i3 also offers a level of <a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html">configuration</a>
that could make you a bit more efficient.
In my case, I set up a mode that&#8217;ll easily let me open my usual programs with
only two key strokes like the following examples:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Ctrl + Super</code> and <code>f</code> will open <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Ctrl + Super</code> then <code>t</code> will open <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/">Thunderbird</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Ctrl + Super</code> then <code>a</code> will open my file manager (<a href="https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start">Thunar</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and so on&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also set up some keybindings that I usually use in my previous setup like
a screenshot capture with <a href="https://github.com/naelstrof/maim">maim</a>,
video capture with <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a>, and
quick switching of windows and workspaces back and forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_status_bar">Status bar</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Along with the keybindings, I also put a status bar usually seen in
desktop environments.
I decided to use the i3bar since it came in by default with i3.
Then I use i3status (also came by default with i3) to fill up some
usually needed information like audio volume loudness, remaining disk
space for root and for home, and RAM and CPU usage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It took a while to configure it but I seriously liking the pace around it so far.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/the-complete-linux-turnabout/i3bar-appearance.webp" alt="The resulting i3bar setup">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 2. The resulting i3bar setup</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_application_launcher">Application launcher</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My personal desktop experience wouldn&#8217;t be complete without an application launcher.
So I considered <a href="https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi"><code>rofi</code></a> to be my best friend on
the matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, i3 uses <a href="http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu"><code>dmenu</code></a> as the application launcher
but I replaced it with rofi since I find it more intuitive and easier to configure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also made rofi to look like a start menu you usually find in desktop environments like
<a href="http://www.xfce.org/">Xfce</a> or <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/KDE">KDE</a>.
It&#8217;s not too shabby if I say so myself.
It&#8217;s quite usable with rofi&#8217;s sidebar mode where you can find windows, desktop entries,
binaries, and even SSH configs.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/the-complete-linux-turnabout/rofi-setup.webp" alt="Customized rofi menu">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 3. Customized rofi menu</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can find
<a href="https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/dotfiles/tree/master/rofi">my rofi config on my GitHub repo</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_desktop_background">Desktop background</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t have the complete desktop experience without a desktop background.
Fortunately, it&#8217;s easier done than said.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the desktop background, I use <a href="http://feh.finalrewind.org/">feh</a> to easily set it
up with the following line in my i3 config file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">exec_always feh --bg-scale ~/wallpapers/sand.jpg</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re curious about the wallpaper, you can view it
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/comments/co9t14/sand/">in this page</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_other_details">Other details</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are still many details left on how my i3 configuration turned out to
be so <a href="https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/dotfiles/blob/master/i3/config">here&#8217;s my i3 config file</a>
if you want to see more of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to get started on i3, I recommend to look into the
<a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html">user guide</a> often.
It has a fantastic introduction and documentation to begin with.
I don&#8217;t think I need to make a post detailing on it, it&#8217;s too nice and beautiful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also recommend looking into the
<a href="https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/i3-starterpack"><code>i3-starterpack</code> GitHub repo by <strong>addy-dclxvi</strong></a>.
It has a great introduction to get started with your i3 setup.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_a_turnaround_for_the_terminal">A turnaround for the terminal</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With a new workflow, comes a new terminal setup.
I used to just leave my terminal setup by default since I don&#8217;t want to
break things by then.
But because of the minimal setup Arch Linux provides at the very start,
it&#8217;s a safe bet to be experimental.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_alacritty">Alacritty</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This time, I tried to stick with a new terminal emulator (or terminal, for short
which I&#8217;ll refer to it by this point).
Initially, I chose <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">Kitty</a> because
it&#8217;s a GPU-based terminal.
Eventually, I switched to <a href="https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/">Alacritty</a>
because it&#8217;s faster on my machine and it supports
<a href="https://github.com/be5invis/iosevka">Iosevka</a>, a beautiful font set I recently discovered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The configuration for my terminal is only through fonts and color scheme.
So there&#8217;s really nothing to discuss here.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_vim">Vim</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> has a reputation for being a meme in the text editors field.
It has unintuitive user experience especially against modern text editors like
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> or <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>
without some manual reading beforehand.
It also has unconventional controls due to the modal philosophy it adheres to.
However, take time to master it and you&#8217;ll be speeding through for most of the
time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I use Vim mostly for writing documents that relies on text formatting languages
like <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a> and
<a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoctor</a>.
My main case, however, is for writing LaTeX.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After I saw <a href="https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/">this post by <strong>Gilles Castel</strong></a>,
I inspired to learn more about Vim since I was also learning LaTeX at the time.
A few weeks later and I was comfortable with my own workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s a few details about it:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug"><code>vim-plug</code></a> as the plugin
manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For writing LaTeX, I use <a href="https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/"><code>vimtex</code></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use <a href="https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura"><code>zathura</code></a> as the live LaTeX viewer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I choose <a href="https://github.com/sirver/UltiSnips"><code>UltiSnips</code></a> as my snippets manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/907th/vim-auto-save"><code>vim-auto-save</code></a> for autosaving
my files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree"><code>nerdtree</code></a> for a built-in
file browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have <a href="https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline"><code>vim-airline</code></a> as the
status bar. It&#8217;s pretty cool looking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/the-complete-linux-turnabout/vim-setup.webp" alt="Fullscreen Vim setup">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 4. Fullscreen Vim setup</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to take a deeper look or just want to see the full config,
<a href="https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/dotfiles/tree/master/vim">you can see it in my dotfiles repo</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ranger">ranger</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I discovered another cool program that lives in the terminal:
<a href="http://ranger.github.io/">ranger</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s a complete file browser with Vim-inspired controls.
It also comes with its own file opener for figuring out which applications
to open for a certain file type.
Both of the file browser and file opener are configurable which
you can edit it with a simple text editor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you know how to use Vim, you mostly know how to use ranger.
The way how you go around a file in Vim is quite similar to how you
explore around a filesystem with Ranger.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s some examples of the similarities:</p>
</div>
<table class="tableblock frame-all grid-all stretch">
<colgroup>

<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">cut the current line</p></td>
<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">cut the current file selection</p></td>

<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">yank (copy) the current line</p></td>
<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">yank (copy) the current file</p></td>

</tbody>
</table>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like Vim, if you master the controls, you would be faster exploring
the filesystem.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick demo of how you explore between different partitions
from home to my blog in another partition back to my dotfiles in
the home directory.</p>

<h2 id="_low_key_ricing">Low-key ricing</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ever since I got my i3 setup to be practically functional, I&#8217;ve dug a rabbithole
of configuring the little details for most of the time.
I&#8217;ve been considering things such as a compositor, application launcher,
screenshot tool, keybinding tool, and a replacement for my status bar
(which I didn&#8217;t by the end of the day).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s when I discovered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/"><code>/r/unixporn</code></a>,
a subreddit for showing off your *Nix (i.e.: Linux, MacOS) configurations and setup.
It&#8217;s also a community for "ricing", an act of adding the visual spices to your setup.
I recommend to check it out if you&#8217;re looking for a starting point.
They&#8217;re pretty friendly for first timers, too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s a satisfying experience seeing my setup to be prettier (and more functional)
with each revision.
More programs come and go to my experimental workflow and eventually settle with a
(hopefully) functional setup.</p>

<p>I said that the reason I&#8217;ve gone full Linux is due to me finding some

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having a full-on Linux system is pretty awesome especially these days where
there are feature-complete software that is being developed given away for free
and have its code open to the public.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I made my migration since I found so much good stuff at Linux and it
doesn&#8217;t worth the effort to make my machine dual-boot it with Windows just
to use one program.</p>
