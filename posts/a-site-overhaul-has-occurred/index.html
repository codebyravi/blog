<p>ANNOUNCEMENT: A site overhaul has occurred. Please
see the changelog. A site overhaul has occurred.
Please see the changelog.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_from_jekyll_to_hugo">From Jekyll to Hugo</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First and foremost, the blog has moved from
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.
I could create a theme but it would take me way longer
than should just to migrate the blog so for now I settled
with the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-terminal/">Terminal</a>
since I&#8217;m starting to appreciate terminal-themed websites
(also, I think it&#8217;s easier for me to design a terminal-themed website
if I have to create one).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve ported the blog to Hugo for multitude of reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Speed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ease of content management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More organized approach for my content</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Built-in support for blogging with <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoctor</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Built-in support for <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoctor</a> although
it&#8217;s mostly done through calling external programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though Jekyll <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">does have a plug-in for blogging with Asciidoctor</a>,
I don&#8217;t really want another plug-in for that. I just want a
static site generator with built-in support for blogging with Asciidoctor and
Hugo just provides that. The speed and ease of configuration is
also a really large bonus.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_change_of_purpose">Change of purpose</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The blog is in hiatus due to me taking notes in
<a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> now and a change of
purpose for my blog. I already have a
<a href="https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/personal-notes/">a storage for my notes</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/a-remote-repo-full-of-notes-of-things-i-do-not-know-about/">another for my lecture/detailed notes</a>
so I don&#8217;t see any point to make this as an all-around notes notebook.
It&#8217;s too repetitive to have it around so the vision for my blog
has changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s what I think my online notes should be divided with these three
outlets:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>My notes storage would be short/slightly detailed notes on random things.
This is basically where my <em>Simplified!</em>-type of notes should get in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My lecture notes are where detailed studies of subjects or concepts
should go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My blog will be about&#8230;&#8203; I don&#8217;t know, really. I do have a set of ideas that I
think it&#8217;s suitable for blogging about it so let&#8217;s just find out along the
way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_blog_clean_up_and_revision">Blog clean-up and revision</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the overall purpose of the blog has been changed, so does the little
details that make up the blog.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve cleaned up my blog by removing most of the posts that I think it&#8217;s not
suitable for the blog anymore. The <em>Learnings and Resources</em> series will be reset
(starting this month) with a couple of revisions and improvement for the reading experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Simplified!</em> series is still going to be up and coming with revisions and a new
style of technical writing. My <a href="https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/personal-notes/">personal notes</a>
is still going to have the style of <em>Simplified!</em> series I was originally going for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about revising my writing style as well. I mostly view my
current style as too verbose. I&#8217;ve learned that it&#8217;s became a
pain to read for my future self if I were to revisit a concept/study again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the revised writing style, I also want to improve my writing by adopting a new
writing workflow. This is basically the stuff you would encounter in a high school
writing class but I&#8217;ve been less compliant with it over the last few posts (before the
change).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The blog is under change and it&#8217;s not suitable to be a student&#8217;s notebook anymore and
it goes on to my <a href="https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/personal-notes/">online</a>
<a href="https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/a-remote-repo-full-of-notes-of-things-i-do-not-know-about/">notes</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Along with the change of purpose is a change of style and presentation for my
studies. Starting with the last quarter of the year is taking the more challenging route
for improvement and hopefully this change reflect that as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well, I still don&#8217;t know how to end this post so have a nice day! :)</p>
