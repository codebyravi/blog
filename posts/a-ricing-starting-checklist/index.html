<p>I just started ricing at the start of August 2019.
So I made this list of things you might want to know when
getting started with ricing your setup so that I couldn&#8217;t
forget it easily.</p>

<p>Hopefully, it can be useful for you, too.</p>

<h2 id="_a_display_server">A display server</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to fully make use of window programs like
Firefox, Inkscape, GIMP, Blender, and many others, you have
to install a display server (or windows server).
Otherwise, you would be stuck using with a command line.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_display_servers">many display servers out there</a>
but one of the more popular choices are <a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/">Xorg</a>
(an implementation of X protocol) and
<a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your hardware is a bit old, I recommend to stick with
Xorg since it is older thus more developed than Wayland.
Wayland is still a relatively new technology still in development
but still keep an eye for it since it is meant to replace X
with simpler options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, I recommend to look at their respective Arch Linux wiki entry
if you want to get started.
(Pretty much I recommend the Arch Linux wiki for most of the
Linux stuff, really.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_a_desktop_environmentwindow_manager">A desktop environment/window manager</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to have that graphical desktop experience, you
either need a <em>desktop environment</em> or a <em>window manager</em>
(or even both).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A window manager does what its name does: manages and controls
windows from its appearance, content, and behavior.
There are
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/window_manager">many choices to choose from</a>
but personally I recommend <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a>, <a href="https://swaywm.org/">Sway</a>,
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bspwm">Bspwm</a>, and
<a href="https://awesomewm.org/">awesome</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually with a window manager, you can extend more stuff with it
such as a status bar and a lock screen to improve your
desktop experience.
Anyways, you should try and experiment with the configuration
of the window manager of your choosing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile, a desktop environment is a more detailed setup
built on top of a window manager.
They have more built-in stuff like a status bar,
a session manager, a display manager, and a window manager of
their own.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like window managers,
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_environment#List_of_desktop_environments">You have many choices</a>
here.
For my personal recommendations, <a href="https://xfce.org/">Xfce</a> and
<a href="https://www.kde.org/plasma-desktop">KDE Plasma</a> is the
top-tier choices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually, desktop environments let you replace their
window manager (or any of their components, if they provided
one).
For example, you can install Xfce and replace their built-in
window manager (<a href="https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfwm4/start">Xfwm</a>)
with i3wm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to use some themes for the desktop environment
of your choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Tip</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
Always check for the requirements of the window manager
or the desktop environment before trying it.
It can affect performance or simply won&#8217;t work because
of incompatibility.

<h2 id="_a_compositor">A compositor</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager">compositor</a>
(or a composite manager) is a program that provides
an off-screen buffer for application windows.
Thus, repainting and rendering application windows will mitigate
against common graphical issues such as screen tearing or leaving a
"trail" or a black block.
Those issues will be way more obvious when moving your windows or
using an application with a lot of moving parts on your screen.
(I can&#8217;t record it since it&#8217;s not present when viewing it in a video.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It can also provide additional processes with those application
windows such as adding transitions, adding animations, and
applying opacity for the windows.
In other words, it can add pizzazz to your setup.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Tip</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
Like window managers, always check for the requirements
before using it.
Certain compositors can only support certain setups or
will break under certain conditions in your setup.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the more popular compositors are
<a href="https://github.com/yshui/compton">Compton</a> for X window system
and <a href="https://swaywm.org/">Sway</a> for Wayland.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you have configured the compositor, you can certainly see
some notable differences with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since I have installed Xorg which is an implementation of the X window
system, I&#8217;m using Compton.
The following videos are demonstrations using without and with Compton
running in the background.</p>

<h2 id="_a_display_manager">A display manager</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A display manager is a graphical interface for logging in a session.
It could be pretty useful for those who are using with multiple users
that might be intimidated with using a TTY as their first screen.
Most importantly, it could be used for additional swag.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Aside from giving the user login interface a makeover, it can also
do other things such as authenticating users and session management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Display_manager#List_of_display_managers">There is a list of choices out there</a>
and my pick is <a href="https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/lightdm/">LightDM</a>
since I find it easy to start and it does have a cool login interface.</p>

<h2 id="_gui_library_themes">GUI library themes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GUI library such as <a href="https://www.gtk.org/">GTK</a> and
<a href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt</a> might have a unified configuration that
describes the widgets appearance, color scheme, and fonts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll be mainly discussing on GTK theming since a lot of widely used
programs are built with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://www.gtk.org/">GTK</a> is a cross-platform free and open source GUI library.
Popular programs built (as of this writing) with the library include
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>,
<a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/">Thunderbird</a>,
<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>, and <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many ways on configuring your color scheme and icon sets but
I recommend to start with <a href="http://wiki.lxde.org/en/LXAppearance">LXAppearance</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/themix-project/oomox">oomox</a>.
Even better you could use them to take a look at a GTK config file and edit
it yourself afterwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You could also not customize it and leave it to the distro.
For Arch Linux, it has Raleigh as the default GTK theme which looks
very dated if you ask me.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/a-ricing-starting-checklist/gtk-raleigh-theme-demo.webp" alt="GTK Raleigh theme">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. GTK Raleigh theme</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For my custom configuration, I chose the <a href="https://github.com/NicoHood/arc-theme">Arc</a>
theme along with its <a href="https://github.com/NicoHood/arc-icon-theme">icon set</a> simply
because they&#8217;re the popular choice. I also think the darker scheme is pretty
cool.</p>

<h2 id="_color_scheme_generator">Color scheme generator</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having your own color scheme for your setup is very great.
However, if you&#8217;re inexperienced with choosing your own colors,
a color scheme generator can help.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a lot software built for it such as <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a>,
<a href="https://color.adobe.com/create">Adobe Color</a>, and
<a href="https://colorpalettes.net/">a color pallete sharing site</a> but
there are two particular program that I personally recommend
because they&#8217;re specifically made for ricing.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_pywal">pywal</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal">pywal</a>, a program that easily generates a
color scheme and replace it with your already existing terminal setup.
You could also make some templates in order to apply it to other programs like
<a href="https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi">rofi</a>, for example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most popular highlights of pywal is that you can generate color schemes
with images.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far, I&#8217;m content with the color scheme generated from
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/comments/cckpj0/i_made_this_simple_and_clean_drawing_over_the/">this image</a>.
It&#8217;s pretty easy on the eyes and it is also cool to be background image for
your desktop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can certainly automate it to make it as your theme selector similar
to how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es79N_9BblE">Luke Smith</a> did with his setup.
Or just like how
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/973qcn/i3rofipywal_automated_theme_switching_with_rofi/">this ricer from <code>/r/unixporn</code> made rofi to be the theme selector</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_wpgtk">wpgtk</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>wpgtk, as it is described in its <a href="https://github.com/deviantfero/wpgtk">own GitHub page</a>,
is a colorscheme, wallpaper and template manager for *nix-based systems.
It is what it is.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It can generate and manage different color scheme with
<a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal">pywal</a> which I discussed it shortly earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can manage wallpapers and templates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comes with a graphical user interface built with <a href="https://www.gtk.org/">GTK</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is a pretty cool tool and can turn ricing into a more satisfying
experience with the convenience it offers.
I fully recommend looking into this tool if you want a cool color scheme
generator and a manager for common ricing tasks.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_a_notification_system">A notification system</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A status bar is not enough fill up some info especially if it&#8217;s not
needed that much.
A desktop notification system could be handy for those situations.
It can also be useful for immediate feedback that is shortly
not needed after.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to setup a notification system working, you need two components:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>a notifier that sends notifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a notification daemon that recieves those notifications</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
If you&#8217;re using with a desktop environment, usually it already
has a notification system installed. Feel free to skip this section
if you want.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the former, <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/libnotify/"><code>libnotify</code></a>
(with <code>notify-send</code>) is the toolbelt for that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the latter, you have more choices.
In my setup, I have <a href="https://dunst-project.org/">Dunst</a> since I see
it included in a lot of posts at <code>/r/unixporn</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dunst is also easy to configure and extend.
You can change the color of the text and background, change the
appearance for notifications of varying urgency levels, and integrate
scripts that&#8217;ll run whenever a certain type of notification has been
recieved.
It&#8217;s pretty fantastic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One very useful example in my case is making a notification for screenshots.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I made a script which takes a screenshot which will be binded with the <code>PrintScr</code> key
which will be used in i3.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In i3, running a script takes place in the background so there&#8217;s no way to know
if the screenshot capture is a success or not unless you send some data to a
server. Simply sending a notification with <code>notify-send</code> while running Dunst in the
background can go a long way.</p>

<p>If you would continue with no tool at all, you would most likely:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>edit and manage it by hand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create a folder where all of your dotfiles are in and symlink it

<li>
<p>create a script that&#8217;ll manage your dotfiles for you ;p</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dotfiles">You have some choices</a>

For me, I chose <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/"><code>stow</code></a> since it is
widely distributed among Linux-based systems. The runner-up is
<a href="https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm"><code>yadm</code></a> which integrates the
concepts usually found in Git.</p>

It&#8217;s a simple thing to backup your dotfiles whether through simple
copy-pasting it in another storage device, an online drive, or
a self-hosted server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For my dotfiles, I simply use a remote Git repo as my online "backup".
I also have the benefit of putting my dotfiles under version control
